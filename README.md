# Geometry
Location of the geometry files

We can put geometry files here to use in the MEGAlib simulation

#Checking out 
The repository locally. The current setup is that each branch is 
it’s own repository, so you’ll have
to check them out all separately. 

git clone https://github.com/ComPair/Geometry.git

git checkout master

#Add to Repository
Note: there is some dancing you have to do 
to add your git name/email to the git config 
file (which is located at ~/.gitconfig)

git add “myfile”

git commit -m “first commit of myfile” 

git push origin master

#Change a file

git commit -m “2nd commit of myfile” myfile

git push origin master
