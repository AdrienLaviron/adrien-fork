# Geometry
Location of the geometry files

We can put geometry files here to use in the MEGAlib simulation

#Checking out the repository locally 
#The current setup is that each branch
#is it’s own repository, so you’ll have
#to check them out all separately. 

>>git clone https://github.com/ComPair/Geometry.git
>>git checkout master

#Here is how to add to the repository
#Note: there is some dancing you have to do 
#to add your git name/email to the git config 
#file (which is located at ~/.gitconfig)

>>git add “myfile”
>>git commit -m “first commit of myfile” 
>>git push origin master

#To make changes to a file

>>git commit -m “2nd commit of myfile” myfile
>>git push origin master
